# Processes

## Pseudoparallelism <!--fc-->
The CPU switching from process to process very quickly, running each for tens or hundreds of milliseconds giving the illusion that they are being run in parallel.

## Multiprocessor <!--fc-->
A system in which multiple CPUs share the same physical memory. This allows for true parallelism.

# The Process Model <!--fc-->
In this model, all runnable software on the computer, sometime including the OS itself, are organized into a number of *sequential processes,* or just *processes* for short
A process is an instance of an executing program, including
- Current values of program counter, registers, variables

## Process Multiprogramming <!--fc-->
Conceptually, each process has its own virtual CPU. In reality, each real CPU switches back and forth from process to process.

# Process Creation <!--fc-->
Four principal events cause processes to be created:
- System initialization
- Execution of a process-creating system call by a running process
- A user request to create a new process
- Initiation of a batch job

## Daemons <!--fc-->
Process that stay in the background to handle some activity such a email, web pages, news, printing, etc.

## Win32 `CreateProcess` <!--fc-->
The way processes are created in windows, handles both process creation and loading the correct program to the new process. Has 10 parameters.


# Process Termination <!--fc-->
Sooner or later processes will terminate, usually due to one of the following conditions
- Normal exit  (voluntary)
- Error exit (voluntary)
- Fatal error (involuntary)
- Killed by another process (involuntary)

## Normal exit syscalls in windows and Unix <!--fc-->
Unix - `exit`
Windows - `ExitProcess`

## System calls for process terminating other process in Windows and Unix <!--fc-->
Unix - `kill`
Windows - `TerminateProcess`
In both cases, the killer must have the necessary authorization to do in the killee.


# Process Hierarchies <!--fc-->
In UNIX, a process and all of its children and further descendants together form a process group.
When a user sends a signal form the keyboard, the signal (e.g.: CTRL-C) is delivered to all members of the process group currently associated with the keyboard.
Individually, each process can catch, ignore the signal, or take the default action, which is to be killed by the signal.

## `init` <!--fc-->
In UNIX, a special process called `init` is present in the boot image.
When it starts, it reads a file telling how many terminals there are, then forks off a new process per terminal.
All processes in the whole system belong to a single tree, with `init` at the root.

## Process hierarchy in windows <!--fc-->
Windows has no concept of a process hierarchy. All processes are equal.
The only hint of process hierarchy is that when a process is created, the parent is given a special token called a *handle* which it can use to control the child.
