# Processes

## Pseudoparallelism <!--fc-->
The CPU switching from process to process very quickly, running each for tens or hundreds of milliseconds giving the illusion that they are being run in parallel.
<!--ID: 1722373461241-->


## Multiprocessor <!--fc-->
A system in which multiple CPUs share the same physical memory. This allows for true parallelism.
<!--ID: 1722373461246-->


# The Process Model <!--fc-->
In this model, all runnable software on the computer, sometime including the OS itself, are organized into a number of *sequential processes,* or just *processes* for short
A process is an instance of an executing program, including
- Current values of program counter, registers, variables
<!--ID: 1722373461251-->


## Process Multiprogramming <!--fc-->
Conceptually, each process has its own virtual CPU. In reality, each real CPU switches back and forth from process to process.

# Process Creation <!--fc-->
Four principal events cause processes to be created:
- System initialization
- Execution of a process-creating system call by a running process
- A user request to create a new process
- Initiation of a batch job
<!--ID: 1722373461260-->


## Daemons <!--fc-->
Process that stay in the background to handle some activity such a email, web pages, news, printing, etc.
<!--ID: 1722373461264-->


## Win32 `CreateProcess` <!--fc-->
The way processes are created in windows, handles both process creation and loading the correct program to the new process. Has 10 parameters.
<!--ID: 1722373461268-->



# Process Termination <!--fc-->
Sooner or later processes will terminate, usually due to one of the following conditions
- Normal exit  (voluntary)
- Error exit (voluntary)
- Fatal error (involuntary)
- Killed by another process (involuntary)
<!--ID: 1722373461278-->


## Normal exit syscalls in windows and Unix <!--fc-->
Unix - `exit`
Windows - `ExitProcess`
<!--ID: 1722373461289-->


## System calls for process terminating other process in Windows and Unix <!--fc-->
Unix - `kill`
Windows - `TerminateProcess`
In both cases, the killer must have the necessary authorization to do in the killee.
<!--ID: 1722373461297-->



# Process Hierarchies <!--fc-->
In UNIX, a process and all of its children and further descendants together form a process group.
When a user sends a signal form the keyboard, the signal (e.g.: CTRL-C) is delivered to all members of the process group currently associated with the keyboard.
Individually, each process can catch, ignore the signal, or take the default action, which is to be killed by the signal.
<!--ID: 1722373461301-->


## `init` <!--fc-->
In UNIX, a special process called `init` is present in the boot image.
When it starts, it reads a file telling how many terminals there are, then forks off a new process per terminal.
All processes in the whole system belong to a single tree, with `init` at the root.
<!--ID: 1722373461305-->


## Process hierarchy in windows <!--fc-->
Windows has no concept of a process hierarchy. All processes are equal.
The only hint of process hierarchy is that when a process is created, the parent is given a special token called a *handle* which it can use to control the child.
<!--ID: 1722373461310-->


# Process States <!--fc-->
Although each process is an independent entity, they often need to interact with other processes.
It may happen that one process is ready to run, but there's no input waiting for it. It must block until some other input is available. This is known a a process state
- Running (actually using the CPU at that instant)
- Ready (runnable; temporarily stopped to let another process run)
- Blocked (unable to run until some external event happens)

# Implementation of Processes

## Process Table <!--fc-->
To implement the process model, the OS maintains a table (array of structs) called the *process table*, with one entry per process.
This entry contains important information about the process' state, including
- Program Counter
- Stack Pointer
- Memory Allocation
- Status of open files
- Accounting and scheduling information
And everything else about the process that must be saved when the process is switched from *running* to *ready* or *blocked.*

<!--ID: 1722373461318-->


## Interrupt Vector <!--fc-->
Associated with each I/O class is a location (typically at a fixed location near the bottom of memory) called the *interrupt vector*.
It contains the address of the *ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)*
E.g.:
	Suppose user process 3 is running when a disk interrupt happens. UP 3's pc, program status word, and one or more registers are pushed onto the (current) stack by the interrupt hardware. The computer then jumps to the address in the interrupt vector.
	That's all the hardware does, the *ISR* does the rest in software.
<!--ID: 1722373461322-->



## How interrupts work <!--fc-->
Each interrupt starts by saving the registers, often in the process table entry for the current process.
Then the information pushed onto the stack by the interrupt is removed and the stack pointer is set to point to a temporary stack used by the process handler.
	 *actions such as saving registers and setting the stack pointer can't be expressed in high-level languages, so they are usually done with small assembly routines*
Then a C procedure is called to do the rest of the work. When it is done its job, the scheduler is called to see what to run next.
After that, control is passed back to the assembly routine to load up the registers and the memory map for the now current process and start it running.

# Modeling Multiprogramming

## CPU utilization formula <!--fc-->
Suppose that a process spends a fraction $p$ of its time waiting for I/O to complete. With $n$ processes in memory at once, the probability that all $n$ processes are waiting for I/O (idle CPU) is $p^n$. The CPU utilization formula is
$$
\text{CPU utilization =}1-p^n
$$
<!--ID: 1722373461330-->


## Degree of multiprogramming <!--fc-->
The different values of $p$ (or I/O wait) as a function of $n$
![[Pasted image 20240730150236.png]]
*if a process spends 80% of its time waiting for I/O, at least 10 processes must be in memory to get CPU waste below 10%*
