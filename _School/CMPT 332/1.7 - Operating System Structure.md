School::CMPT 332::01.7 - Operating System Structure

In the following Section, we will examining six different structures that have been tried when developing operating systems.

# Monolithic Systems <!--fc-->
The most common organization, the OS is ran as a single program in kernel mode.
To construct this actual program, all of the individual procedures are compiled and then bound together into a single executable using the system linker.
<!--ID: 1722304495344-->



## Structure of monolithic OS <!--fc-->
The basic structure for this type of OS is
- a main procedure that invokes everything else
- a set of service procedures
- a set of utility procedures for those service procedures.

## Shared Libraries <!--fc-->
Components that are loaded on demand, not bound to main program at compile time
<!--ID: 1722304495352-->



# Layered Systems <!--fc-->
A generalization of the monolithic approach, it is to organize the OS as a hierarchy of layers, each one constructed upon the layer below it.
![[Pasted image 20240729080708.png]]
With the layered approach, designers have a choice of where to draw the kernel-user boundary
<!--ID: 1722304495356-->



# Microkernels <!--fc-->
A strong case can be made for putting as little possible of the OS in kernel mode because bugs in the kernel can bring down the system instantly.
- Achieve high reliability by splitting the OS up into small, well defined modules, only one of which, the kernel, runs in kernel mode.
![[Pasted image 20240729085715.png]]
Outside the kernel, the system is structured as three layers of processes all running in user mode. The lowest layer contains the device drivers.
To program an IO device, the driver builds a structure telling which values to write to which IO ports and makes a kernel call telling the kernel to do the write.

## Servers in Microkernel <!--fc-->
Do most of the work of the OS. *Not network servers*
One or more file servers manage the file system, the process manager manages processes, and so on.\
<!--ID: 1722304495366-->


### Reincarnation server <!--fc-->
Checks if the other servers and drivers are functioning correctly. In the even a faulty one is detected, it is automatically replaced without any user intervention.
<!--ID: 1722304495370-->



## POLA (Principle of Least Authority) <!--fc-->
Restricting what a component can do to exactly what it needs to do its work.
E.g.: The MINIX system access to kernel calls is controlled on a per-process basis, as is the ability to send messages to other processes. 
Processes can grant limited permission for other processes to have kernel access to their address space (file system can grant permission for the disk driver to let kernel put new block at specific address)
<!--ID: 1722304495375-->




# Client-Server Model <!--fc-->
Distinguishes two classes of processes
- Servers - which provides some service
- Clients - Make use of the services
Communication between clients and servers is often by message passing.
This can be used for a single machine or a network of machines, i.e.: clients and servers run on different computers, connected by a local or wide area network

# Virtual Machines

## Virtual Machine Monitor <!--fc-->
Runs on the bare hardware and does the multiprogramming, providing several virtual machines to the next layer up
![[Pasted image 20240729150331.png]]
<!--ID: 1722304495384-->



## Type 1 hypervisor <!--fc-->
The modern term for virtual machine monitor. Allows you to run multiple OSs on a single machine

<!--ID: 1722304495389-->




## Machine Simulators <!--fc-->
Improved performance for VMs over interpreters by translating blocks of code on the fly, storing them in an internal cache, and then reusing them.
This technique is called *binary translation*.
![[Pasted image 20240729153009.png]]
<!--ID: 1722304495393-->




## Type 2 hypervisor <!--fc-->
Uses machine simulation (binary translation) as well as adding a kernel module to do some of the heavy lifting, hybrid strategy
![[Pasted image 20240729153440.png]]
<!--ID: 1722304495398-->



## Distinction between type 1 and 2 hypervisors <!--fc-->
Type 2 hypervisors make uses of a *host operating system* and its file system to create processes, store files, etc.
A type 1 hypervisor has no underlying support and must perform all these functions itself.
- After a type 2 hypervisor is started, it reads the installation image file for the chosen *guest operating system* and installs the guest OS on a virtual disk. Type 1 hypervisors can't do this because there is no host OS to store files on. The must manage their own storage on a raw disc partition.

# The Java Virtual Machine <!--fc-->
The Java compiler produces code for JVM, which then typically is executed by a software JVM interpreter. This way, JVM code can be shipped over the Internet to any computer with a JVM interpreter and run there.
<!--ID: 1722304495407-->



# Containers <!--fc-->
Besides full virtualization, we can also run multiple instances of an operating system on a single machine at the same time by having the operating system itself support different systems, or *containers*.
Containers are provided by the host OS and mostly run just the user mode portion of the OS.
Each container shares the host OS system kernel and binaries/libraries in a read-only fashion.

# Exokernels and Unikernels

## Exokernel <!--fc-->
Rather than cloning the actual machine, as done with VMs, another strategy is partitioning it.
At the bottom layer, running in kernel mode, is the *exokernel*
Its job is to allocate resources to VMs and then check attempts to use them to make sure no machine is trying to use another's resources.
- Avoids mapping (VMs think they have their own memory from 0 to some max, so monitor must maintain tables to remap)
<!--ID: 1722304495416-->



## Unikernel <!--fc-->
The operating system functions were linked with the applications in the virtual
machine in the form of a LibOS (Library Operating System), that needed only
the functionality for the application(s) running in the user-level virtual machine.
A modern version of this is unikernels; minimal systems that contain just enough functionality to support a single application (such as a web server) on a VM. Highly efficient.
