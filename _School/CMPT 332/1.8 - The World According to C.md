School::CMPT 332::01.8 - The World According to C

Operating Systems are normally large C programs consisting of many pieces written by many programmers. This section gives a very brief introduction to the word of writing an operating system.

# Header Files <!--fc-->
An OS project generally consists of some number of directories, each containing code for some part of the system, along with some .h header files that contain declarations used by code in one or more files.

## Conditional Compilation <!--fc-->
Included in header files
```C
#ifdef X86
intel_int_ack();
#endif
```
Which compiles into a call to the function `intel_int_ack()` if the macro `X86` is defined and nothing otherwise.
Used heavily to isolate architecture dependent code.

# Large Programming Projects <!--fc-->
To build an OS, each .c is compiled into an *object file*.
- The first pass of the C compiler is called the *C preprocessor*, it takes care of `#include` statements, macros, etc.
- Once all .o files are ready, they are passed into a *linker* to combine all of them into a single binary exe.
