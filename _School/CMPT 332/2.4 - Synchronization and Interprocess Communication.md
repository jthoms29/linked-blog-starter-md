# Race Conditions
Can affect both process and threads

## Print Spooler <!--fc-->
When a process wants to print a file, it enters the file name in a special *spooler directory*.
Another process, the *printer daemon*, periodically checks to see if there are any files to be printed. IF there are, it prints them and then removes their names from the directory.
<!--ID: 1722724066498-->


## Race Condition <!--fc-->
Two or more processes are reading or writing some shared data and the final result depends on who runs precisely when.
*E.g.:*
	![[Pasted image 20240802182614.png]]
	Two processes want to queue a file for printing in the spooler directory.
	Process $A$ reads *in* and stores the index 7
	Just then, a clock interrupt occurs and the CPU switched to process $B$, which also reads *in* and gets 7
	Process $B$ then saves it's filename in 7 and switches *in* to 8.
	When the CPU switches back to $A$, it will overwrite the filename written in 7 by $B$

# Critical Regions

## Mutual Exclusion <!--fc-->
Making sure that if one process is using a shared variable or file, other processes will be excluded for doing the same thing.

## Critical Region/Section <!--fc-->
The part of a program where shared memory is accessed.
<!--ID: 1722724066528-->


## Four Conditions for avoiding race conditions <!--fc-->
- No two processes may be simultaneously inside their critical regions
- No assumptions may be made about speeds or the number of CPUs
- No process running outside its critical region may block any process
- No process should have to wait forever to enter its critical region
<!--ID: 1722724066542-->



# Mutual Exclusion with Busy Waiting

## Disabling Interrupts <!--fc-->
On a single processer system, the simplest solution for mutual exclusions is to have each process disable all interrupts just after entering its critical region and re-enable them just before leaving.
- Unattractive - unwise to give user processes the ability to turn of CPU interrupts
<!--ID: 1722724066558-->


## Lock Variables <!--fc-->
Software solution for mutual exclusion
Uses a single shared lock variable, initially set to 0. When a process wants to enter its critical region. If the lock is 0, it sets it to 1 and enters. If not, it waits until the lock becomes 0.
- Same flaw as spooler directory - processes can swap just as change to variable is made
<!--ID: 1722724066572-->


## Strict Alternation <!--fc-->
Solution for mutual exclusion
![[Pasted image 20240803101241.png]]
- The variable `turn` keeps track of whose turn it is to enter the critical region and examine or update the shared region. When a process (1 or 0) finishes in the region, it changes the `turn` variable to the other process. The other process then may enter
<!--ID: 1722724066590-->


### Busy Waiting <!--fc-->
Continuously testing a variable until some value appears. Should generally be avoided since it wastes CPU time.
<!--ID: 1722724066604-->


### Spin Lock <!--fc-->
A lock that uses busy waiting. Strict alteration would be considered a spin lock.
<!--ID: 1722724066621-->


### Why strict alteration isn't a good solution <!--fc-->
This won't necessarily work
	Process 0 finishes, sets `turn` to 1, 1 finishes quickly so that both processes are in non-critical regions with `turn` set to 0
If 0 is busy in it's not critical region, 1 is unable to enter
**No process outside its critical region may block any process**
<!--ID: 1722724066633-->


## Peterson's Solution <!--fc-->
Software solution for mutual exclusion
Before entering a critical region, each process calls `enter_region` with its own process number (0,1) as a parameter. causing it to wait if need be until it is safe to enter.
After it has finished with the shared variables, the process calls `leave_region` to indicate that it is done and to allow the other process to enter.
![[Pasted image 20240803110837.png]]
- Initially, neither process is in its critical region
- Process 0 calls `enter_region`, indicates interest by setting array element to `TRUE` and `turn` to 0
- If process 1 now makes a call to `enter_region`, it will hang there until `intersted[0]` goes to `FALSE`, an event that only happens when process 0 calls `leave_region`
Even if both processes call `enter_region` almost simultaneously, whichever last stores it's number in `turn` will be the one allowed in.

## The TSL Instruction <!--fc-->
Some computers, especially those with multiple processes in mind, have an instruction like
```ASM
TSL RX, LOCK
```
*Test and Set Lock*
Reads the contents of the memory word *lock* in register RX and then stores a nonzero value at the memory address *lock*. The operations of the instruction are guaranteed to be indivisible - Not other processer can access the memory word until the the instruction is finished.
It achieves this by locking the memory bus <- works on all processors on system.
<!--ID: 1722724066662-->


### Using the TSL instruction for mutual exclusion. <!--fc-->
To use the `TSL` instruction, we will use a shared variable, `lock`, to coordinate access to shared memory.
When `lock` is 0, any process may set it to 1 using the `TSL` instruction and then read or write the shared memory.
When it is done, the process sets `lock` back to 0 using an ordinary `move` instruction.
![[Pasted image 20240803145220.png]]
Before entering its critical region, the process calls `enter_region`, which does busy waiting until the lock is free. After leaving the critical region, the process calls `leave_region`, which stores 0 in `lock`.
<!--ID: 1722724066679-->


## XCHG instruction <!--fc-->
Alternative instruction to `TSL`, exchanges the contents of two locations atomically, for example a register and a memory word
![[Pasted image 20240803162652.png]]
All Intel x86 CPUs use `XCHG` for low-level synchronization
