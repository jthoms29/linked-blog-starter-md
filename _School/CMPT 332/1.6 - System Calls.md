School::CMPT 332::01.6 - System Calls

# System Calls <!--fc-->
Any single-CPU computer can execute only one instruction at a time. If a process is running a user program in user mode and needs a system service, such as reading data from a file, it has to execute a trap instruction to transfer control to the operating system.

## Error checking <!--fc-->
Programs should always check the results of a system call to see if an error has occurred.
<!--ID: 1722175906404-->


## Trap instruction <!--fc-->
Switches from user mode to kernel mode to user modes and starts execution at a **fixed address** (not arbitrary like procedure) within the kernel and the return address is saved on the stack for later, sort of like a procedure call.

# System Calls for Process Management
![[Pasted image 20240727204913.png]]

## `fork` <!--fc-->
System call that creates an exact duplicate of the original process, including all file descriptors, registers, everything.
The data is *copied*, so the processes are independent.
<!--ID: 1722175906413-->


## Copy on write <!--fc-->
Two processes (`fork`) share a single physical copy of the memory until one of the two modifies a value at a location in memory, in which case the operating system makes a copy of the small chunk of memory containing that location.
<!--ID: 1722175906416-->


## PID (process identifier) <!--fc-->
*Process Identifier*
When fork creates a process, it returns 0 in the child and the child's PID in the parent. You can use this PID to check which is the parent or child.
<!--ID: 1722175906428-->


## `Waitpid` <!--fc-->
A system call which makes a parent process wait until a child process terminates.
The shell does this when it starts a process, runs it, and then goes back to taking input.
- `Waitpid` can wait for a specific child, or any child by setting the first parameter to -1.
<!--ID: 1722175906438-->


## `execve` <!--fc-->
A system call which causes a processes' entire core image to be replaced by the file named in its first parameter.
Three parameters
- name of file to be executed
- pointer to argument array
- pointer to environment array
<!--ID: 1722175906447-->


## How does the shell start a new process <!--fc-->
- Takes user prompt to start process
- `fork`s new process and calls `waitpid` to wait for child to exit
- Use `execve` system call to make child process execute user command

## Memory segments for processes in UNIX <!--fc-->
- Text segment (program code) *bottom*
- data segment (variables) 
- Stack segment
Data grows upward and stack grows downward and there's a gap in the middle.
- The stack grows into the stack automatically as needed, but the data segment must be expanded with the system call `brk`

# System Calls for File Management

## Opening File <!--fc-->
Use the `open` syscall.
This specifies the file name to be opened as a path (absolute or relative) as well as how it is to be opened
- `O_RDONLY`
- `O_WRONLY`
- `O_RDWR`
- `O_CREAT` - create new file
Files can be closed with `close`
<!--ID: 1722176545138-->


## File position pointer <!--fc-->
Some applications need to access any part of a file at random
Associated with each file is a pointer that indicates the current position in the file. 
When reading/writing sequentially, it usually points to the next byte to read/write
`lseek` can be used to change position in the file
*param:*
- file descriptor
- file position
- whether position is absolute, to the current position, or from the end

# System Calls for Directory Management

## `mkdir/rmdir` <!--fc-->
System calls that create and remove empty directories, respectively
<!--ID: 1722180894704-->


## `link` <!--fc-->
System call that allows the same file to appear under two or more names, often in different directories.
- These are not private copies, having a shared file means the changes one person makes are immediately visible to other people - there's only one file.

<!--ID: 1722180894708-->


### How the `link` syscall works <!--fc-->
Every file in UNIX has an i-number that identifies it. It's an index into a table of *i-nodes*, one per file, telling who owns the file, where the disk blocks are, etc.
`link` creates a brand new directory entry using the i-number of an existing file.
<!--ID: 1722180894713-->


## `mount` <!--fc--> 
System call, allows two file systems to be merged into one.
*params:*
- Name of a block special file for USB drive 0
- Place in the tree it is to be mounted
- read or write only

# Miscellaneous System Calls

## `chdir` <!--fc-->
System call, changes the current working directory
![[Pasted image 20240728092328.png]]
After this call, an open on the file `xyz` will open `/usr/ast/test/xyz`
<!--ID: 1722180894722-->


## `chmod` <!--fc-->
In UNIX every file has a mode used for protection (ogo).
The `chmod` syscall makes it possible to change the mode of a file.
`chmod("file", 0644)` <- makes file read only by everyone except the owner.
