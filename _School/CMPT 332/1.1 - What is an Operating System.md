School::CMPT 332::01.1 - What is an Operating System

# Introduction
## Operating system <!--fc-->
Provides user programs with a better, simpler, cleaner model of the computer to handle managing all of the computer's resources.

## Methods for the user to interact with the system <!--fc-->
- Shell - Text based
- GUI - Graphics based
<!--ID: 1722043380849-->



## Two modes of computer operation <!--fc-->
- Kernel Mode
	Operating system runs in this mode, gives complete access to all hardware and can execute any instruction the machine is capable of executing
- User mode
	Rest of the software runs in this mode, only a subset of D instructions are available, I/O is off limits.

# What is an Operating System

## Files
All operating systems provide a layer of abstraction for using discs; *files*
Using this abstraction, programmers can create, write, and read files without having to deal with the messy details of how hardware actually works.

## Resource Management
Modern operating systems allow multiple programs to be in memory and run at the same time. It brings order to potential chaos by buffering all the output form these processes

### Multiplexing <!--fc-->
Sharing resources in two different ways; time and space.
- When a resource in *time multiplexed*, different programs or users take turns using it.
- When a resource is *space multiplexed*, resources are split to give to multiple processes (e.g.; multiple programs in memory at once.)
