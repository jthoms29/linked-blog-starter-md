## Reasons for using threads <!--fc-->
- Many applications have multiple activities going on at once. By decomposing the application into multiple sequential threads that run in quasi-parallel, the programming model becomes simpler
- Lighter than processes - easier (faster) to create and destroy
- When there is substantial computing and I/O (i.e.: not all threads are CPU bound) they allow for speed up.
- Useful on multicore systems - true parallelism

## Threads in web servers <!--fc-->
- *Dispatcher* thread reads incoming requests for work form the network. Chooses an idle
- *Worker thread* and hands it the request. The dispatcher than wakes up the worker

# The Classical Thread Model

## Each thread has <!--fc-->
Each thread has: 
- a program counter associated with it
- registers
- a stack
![[Pasted image 20240731081718.png]]
Threads and processes are different entities. Processes are used to group resources together, threads are the entities scheduled for execution on the CPU.
<!--ID: 1722463622907-->


## Lightweight Process <!--fc-->
Another name for threads, since threads have some of the properties of processes.
<!--ID: 1722463622913-->


## Address space for threads in a single process <!--fc-->
All threads have the same address space, meaning they share the same global variables
Since every thread can access every mem-address within a process' address space, they can wipe out another thread's stack.
There is no protection between threads since
- it's impossible
- it's unnecessary
A process is always owned by a single user, who has presumably created multiple threads so they won't fight, unlike disparate processes made by different users.

## Creating threads <!--fc-->
When multithreading is present, processes usually start with a single thread present. This thread has the ability to create new threads by calling a library procedure such as `thread_create`
- A parameter to `thread_create` specifies the name of a procedure for the new thread to run
When a thread has finished its work, it can exit by calling a library procedure such as `thread_exit`
<!--ID: 1722463622929-->


## `thread_join` <!--fc-->
In some systems, one thread can wait for a specific thread to exit by calling a procedure such as `thread_join`.
This procedure blocks the calling thread until a specific thread has exited.
<!--ID: 1722463622939-->


## `thread_yield` <!--fc-->
Common procedure for threads, allows a thread to voluntarily give up the CPU to let another thread run
- Important because there is not clock interrupt to actually enforce multiprogramming as there is with processes.
<!--ID: 1722463622946-->


# POSIX Threads <!--fc-->
To make it possible to write portable threaded programs, IEEE has defined s standard for threads.
The threads package it defines is called **Pthreads**. Most UNIX systems support it
![[Pasted image 20240731085216.png]]
All Pthreads threads have
- An identifier
- Set of registers (including PC)
- set of attributes - stored in attributes structure (stack size, scheduling parameters, etc)
<!--ID: 1722463622952-->


## `pthread_create` <!--fc-->
Creates a new thread. The thread identifier is returned as the function value.
Intentionally very much like `fork` syscall with the identifier playing the role of the PID.
You can terminate a thread with `pthread_exit`
<!--ID: 1722463622957-->


## `pthread_join` <!--fc-->
Waits for a specific other the thread to terminate. The thread identifier of the thread to wait for is given as a parameter.
<!--ID: 1722463622961-->


## `pthread_yield` <!--fc-->
Allows you to give another thread the chance to run when you feel one has run long enough.
<!--ID: 1722463622965-->


## `Pthread_attr_init` <!--fc-->
Creates the attribute structure associated with a thread and initializes it to the default values.
These values (such as priority) can be changed by manipulating fields in the attribute structure.
<!--ID: 1722463622970-->


## `pthread_attr_destroy` <!--fc-->
Removes a thread's attribute structure, freeing up its memory. It does not affect the threads using it, they continue to exist.
<!--ID: 1722463622974-->

# Implementing Threads in User Space <!--fc-->
There are two main places to implement threads: user space and the kernel.
The first method is to put the threads package entirely in user space. The kernel knows nothing about them. As far as it knows, it's managing an ordinary single threaded process.
The threads run on top of a run-time system, which is a collection of procedures that manage threads
![[Pasted image 20240731142139.png]]
<!--ID: 1722463622978-->


## Thread run-time system <!--fc-->
A collection of procedures that manage user space threads
<!--ID: 1722463622984-->


## User Space Thread Table <!--fc-->
When threads are managed in user space, each process needs its own private thread table to keep track of the threads in process.
Analogous to the kernel's process table, except that it keeps track only of the per-thread properties, i.e.
- PC
- Stack pointer
- registers
- state
- etc
The thread is managed by the run-time system. When a thread is moved to the ready or blocked state, the info needed to restart it is stored in the thread table, similar to the process table in the kernel.
<!--ID: 1722463622990-->


## Thread switch <!--fc-->
When a thread does something that may cause it to become blocked locally, it calls a runtime procedure.
This procedure checks to see if the thread needs to be put in a blocked state. If so, it stores the thread's registers in the thread table, looks in the table for the ready thread to run, and reloads the machine registers with the new threads saved values. 
  Doing this for user space threads in much faster than switching to the kernel.
<!--ID: 1722463622996-->


## System Call Wrapper <!--fc-->
User-level threads packages have problems, first of which is the problem of how blocking system calls are implemented
Letting a thread make a system call is unacceptable, since this will stop all threads.
In most versions of UNIX, a system call `select` exists which allows the caller to tell whether a prospective system call will block.
When this call is present, the library procedure `read` can be replaced with a new one that does a `select` call and then does a `read` call only if it will not block.
If the read call will block, the call is not made, another thread is run instead. The next time the run-time system gets control, it can check to see if the `read` is now safe.
The code placed around the system call to do the checking is called a *wrapper*
<!--ID: 1722463623002-->


## Issues with user level threads <!--fc-->
- Can't do blocking system calls
- Threads can run forever if they don't voluntarily give up to CPU
<!--ID: 1722463623006-->


# Implementing Threads in the Kernel <!--fc-->
![[Pasted image 20240731150536.png]]
There is now no need for a run-time system or thread table in each process. Instead, the kernel has a thread table that keeps track of all the threads in the system. Thread creation and destruction is done with kernel calls.
When a thread blocks, the kernel may choose to run either another thread from the same process or one from a different process.
<!--ID: 1722463623010-->


## Blocking system calls for kernel space threads <!--fc-->
All calls that might block a thread are implemented as system calls, at a considerably greater cost than run time procedures.
<!--ID: 1722463623014-->


## Thread recycling
Due to the greater cost of creating and destroying threads in the kernel, some systems recycle their threads.
When a thread is destroyed, it is just marked as non-runnable but the associated data structures aren't affected.
When a new thread is created, the old thread is reactivated, saving some overhead.

## Issues with kernel level threads <!--fc-->
- Unclear what happens when forks
- Unclear what happens when thread receives signals
- Managing threads with kernel takes a lot of time
<!--ID: 1722463623018-->



# Hybrid Thread implementation <!--fc-->
![[Pasted image 20240731152648.png]]
Various ways have been investigated to try and combine the advantages of user-level threads with kernel-level threads.
One way is to use kernel-level threads and then multiplex user-level threads onto some or all of them.
With this approach, the kernel is aware only of the kernel level threads and thus schedules those.
Threads within threads.

# Making Single-Threaded Code Multithreaded
Converting single-threaded processes to multithreaded ones is tricky.
\
## Private Global Variables <!--fc-->
The code of a thread consists of multiple procedures with variables, global variables, and parameters.
Global variables that are global to a thread and also the entire program are a problem. These are global in the sense that any procedure in the thread should use them, but other threads should leave them alone.
![[Pasted image 20240731154318.png]]
- One solution is to prohibit global variables all together
- Another is to assign each thread it's own private global variables (new scoping level)
	variables are visible to all procedures in a thread, but not to other threads
<!--ID: 1722463623031-->


## Implementing Private Global Variables <!--fc-->
It's possible to allocate a chunk of memory for globals and pass it to each procedure in the thread as an extra parameter
A better solution is to use library procedures
```C
create_global("bufptr");
```
- This allocates storage for a pointer called `bufptr` on the heap. 
Two calls are needed to access global variables, one for reading and writing
```C
set_global("bufptr", &buf); //stores value of pointer in storage location
bufptr = read_global("bufptr"); //returns address stored so data can be accessed
```
<!--ID: 1722463623036-->


## Non-reentrant Procedures <!--fc-->
Procedures which were not designed to have a second call made to any given procedure wall a previous call has not yet finished.
	Sending a message over the network may be programmed to assemble the message in a fixed bugger within the library, then to trap to the kernel to send it. What happens if one thread has assembled its message in the buffer, then a clock interrupt forces a switch to a second thread that immediately overwrites the buffer with its own message?
<!--ID: 1722463623042-->


## Working around non-reentrant procedures using threads <!--fc-->
Provide each procedure with a wrapper that sets a bit to mark the library as being in use. Any attempt for another thread to use a library procedure while a previous call has not been finished is blocked.
