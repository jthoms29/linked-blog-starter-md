# Thread Usage

## Thread <!--fc-->
Multiple miniprocesses within a single address space (process).

## Reasons for using threads <!--fc-->
- Many applications have multiple activities going on at once. By decomposing the application into multiple sequential threads that run in quasi-parallel, the programming model becomes simpler
- Lighter than processes - easier (faster) to create and destroy
- When there is substantial computing and I/O (i.e.: not all threads are CPU bound) they allow for speed up.
- Useful on multicore systems - true parallelism

## Threads in web servers <!--fc-->
- *Dispatcher* thread reads incoming requests for work form the network. Chooses an idle
- *Worker thread* and hands it the request. The dispatcher than wakes up the worker

# The Classical Thread Model

## Each thread has <!--fc-->
Each thread has: 
- a program counter associated with it
- registers
- a stack

Threads and processes are different entities. Processes are used to group resources together, threads are the entities scheduled for execution on the CPU.

## Lightweight Process <!--fc-->
Another name for threads, since threads have some of the properties of processes.

## Address space for threads in a single process <!--fc-->
All threads have the same address space, meaning they share the same global variables
Since every thread can access every mem-address within a process' address space, they can wipe out another thread's stack.
There is no protection between threads since
- it's impossible
- it's unnecessary
A process is always owned by a single user, who has presumably created multiple threads so they won't fight, unlike disparate processes made by different users.

## Creating threads <!--fc-->
When multithreading is present, processes usually start with a single thread present. This thread has the ability to create new threads by calling a library procedure such as `thread_create`
- A parameter to `thread_create` specifies the name of a procedure for the new thread to run
When a thread has finished its work, it can exit by calling a library procedure such as `thread_exit`

## `thread_join` <!--fc-->
In some systems, one thread can wait for a specific thread to exit by calling a procedure such as `thread_join`.
This procedure blocks the calling thread until a specific thread has exited.

## `thread_yield` <!--fc-->
Common procedure for threads, allows a thread to voluntarily give up the CPU to let another thread run
- Important because there is not clock interrupt to actually enforce multiprogramming as there is with processes.
