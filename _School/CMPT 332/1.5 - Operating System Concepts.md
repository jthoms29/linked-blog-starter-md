# Processes <!--fc-->
A process is a program in execution. Associated with each process is its address space.
A process is fundamentally a container that holds all the information needed to run a program.
<!--ID: 1722175906466-->


## Address Space <!--fc-->
A list of memory locations from 0 to some maximum, which a process can read and write.
The address space contains the executable program, the program's data, and its stack.
<!--ID: 1722175906471-->


## Process Table <!--fc-->
When a process is suspended temporarily to allow another to run, it must be restarted in exactly the same state it was stopped. The info about the process must be saved during the suspension.
All information about each process (other than the contents of its address space) are stored in an operating system table called the *process table*, which is an array of structures, one for each process currently in existence.

## Core Image <!--fc-->
The address space of a process.  In honor of the magnetic core memories used.
<!--ID: 1722175906487-->


## Command Interpreter <!--fc-->
Also known as the shell.
<!--ID: 1722175906494-->


## Child Processes <!--fc-->
A process created by one or more other processes
*E.g.: The user requests a programs is to be compiled. The shell (a process) must then create a new process to run the compiler*.

## Interprocess Communication <!--fc-->
Related processes that are cooperating to get some job done often need to communicate with one another and synchronize their activities. This is called *interprocess communication*.
<!--ID: 1722175906506-->


## Alarm Signal <!--fc-->
There may be a need to convey info to a process that is currently busy. To avoid losing information because of this, the sender may request its operating system notify it after a set number off seconds so it can retransmit the message if no acknowledgment has been received.
When these seconds have elapsed, the OS sends an *alarm signal* to the process. T
This causes the process to suspend what it was doing, save registers to the stack, and start running a special signal handling procedure to retransmit the lost message.
<!--ID: 1722175906511-->


# Address Spaces <!--fc-->
Sophisticated operating systems allow multiple programs to be in memory at the same time. To keep them from interfering with one another, some kind of protection mechanism is needed. Hardware provides this mechanism, and the OS controls it.
The address space of the process is the memory that it is allowed to use.
<!--ID: 1722175906522-->


# Files  <!--fc-->
A major function of the OS is to hide the peculiarities of SSDs, disks, and other I/O devices. This is what the file system does.
<!--ID: 1722175906532-->


## Directory <!--fc-->
Sometimes called a *folder* or a *map*, a way of grouping files together.
System calls are needed to create and remove directories, and to add and remove files from directories.

## Pathname <!--fc-->
Every file within a directory hierarchy can be specified by giving its path name from the root directory
`/Faculty/Prof.Brown/Courses/CS101`
<!--ID: 1722175906552-->


## Working directory <!--fc-->
Each process has a current working directory, in which path names not beginning with a slash are looked for
`/Faculty/Prof.Brown/Courses/CS101`
If `/Faculty/Prof.Brown` was the cwd, use of the path `Coursers/CS101` would work the same as giving the full pathname.
<!--ID: 1722175906557-->


## File Descriptor <!--fc-->
Before a file can be read or written it must be opened, at which time the permissions are checked. If the access is permitted, the system returns a small integer called a *file descriptor* to use in subsequent operations.
<!--ID: 1722175906567-->


## Mounted File System <!--fc-->
To allow access to files on CDs, flash drives, etc., Unix allows the file systems on these separate devices to be attached to the main tree. The file systems don't even have to be formatted the same way.

## Special Files <!--fc-->
Provided in order to make I/O devices look like files. This way, they can be read and written using the same system calls as are used for reading and writing files.
Kept in the `/dev` directory by convention.
<!--ID: 1722175906582-->


### Block Special Files <!--fc-->
Used to model devices that consist of a collection of randomly addressable blocks, such as SSDs and disks.
<!--ID: 1722175906587-->


### Character Special Files <!--fc-->
Used to mode, printers, keyboards, mice, and other devices that accept or output a character stream.
<!--ID: 1722175906591-->


## Pipe <!--fc-->
A pipe is a sort of pseudofile that can be used to connect two processes.
![[Pasted image 20240727141912.png]]
When process $A$ wants to send data to process $B$, it writes on the pipe as though it were an output file. Process $B$ can read the data by reading from the pipe as though it were an input file.
<!--ID: 1722175906603-->


# Input/Output <!--fc-->
Every OS has an I/O subsystem for managing its I/O devices. Some of the I/O software is device independent. Other parts of it, such as drivers, are specific to particular I/O devices.
<!--ID: 1722175906610-->


# Protection <!--fc-->
It is up to the OS to manage the system security so that files, for example, are accessible only to authorized users
Files in Unix are protected by assigning each one 9-bit binary protection code
Each consists of three 3-bit fields, owner, group, other.
`rwxr-x--x`

# The Shell
Although not technically part of the operating system, the shell makes heavy use of many OS features.

## Prompt <!--fc-->
When the shell starts, it types out the *prompt*, a character such as a dollar sign, which tells the user that the shell is waiting to accept a command.
When the user types a command to run a process, the shell creates a child process.
