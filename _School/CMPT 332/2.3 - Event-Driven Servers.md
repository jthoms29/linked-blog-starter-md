School::CMPT 332::02.3 - Event-Driven Servers

# Event-Driven Server <!--fc-->
Suppose that for a web server threads are not available, but the designers find the performance loss due to single threading unacceptable
If nonblocking system calls such as `read` are available, a third approach is possible. When a request comes in, the only thread examines it. If it can be satisfied from the cache, fine, but if not, a nonblocking disk operation is started.
The server records the state of the current request in a table an then goes and gets the next event. If it is new work, the work is started. If it is a reply from the disk, the relevant info is fetched from the table and the reply processed.

## Finite-state machine <!--fc-->
Not a sequential process. The state of computation is explicitly saved and restored every time the server switches from one request to a another. 
Like a simulation of processes or threads the hard way
A design like this where computation state is saved and there exists a set of events that can change state is called a *finite-state machine.*

## Event-driven programming paradigm <!--fc-->
Programming that is not sequential but driven by events. Implemented as a finite-state machine. Usually used in high throughput servers where threads are considered too expensive.

## Asynchronous System calls <!--fc-->
Non-blocking (don't have to wait until it returns)

# Single-Threaded vs Multi-Threaded vs Event Driven Servers <!--fc-->
- Single threaded retains the simplicity of blocking system calls but gives up performance
- Multithreads make it possible to retains sequential processes that make blocking calls
- Event driven also achieves high performance through parallelism but uses nonblocking calls and interrupts to do so. Harder to program
