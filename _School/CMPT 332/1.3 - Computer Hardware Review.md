# Computer Hardware Review
Conceptually, a simple personal computer can be abstracted to model resembling a CPU, memory, and I/O devices connected by a system bus.

## Processors <!--fc-->
The 'brain' of the computer is the CPU
The basic cycle of every CPU is to fetch the first instruction from memory, decode it to determine it's type and operands, execute it, and the fetch, decode and execute subsequent instructions
<!--ID: 1722043380756-->


### Program Counter <!--fc-->
A register that contains the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched. After the instruction has been fetched, the program counter is updated to point to its successor.
<!--ID: 1722043380760-->


### Stack Pointer <!--fc-->
A register that points to the top of the current stack in memory.
The stack contains one frame for each procedure that has been entered but not yet exited. A procedure's stack frame holds those input parameters, local variables, and temporary variables that are not kept in registers.
<!--ID: 1722043380764-->


### PSW (Program Status Word) <!--fc-->
A register that contains the condition code bits, which are set by comparison instructions, CPU priority, the mode (user or kernel) and various other control bits. Plays an important role in system calls and I/O.
<!--ID: 1722043380768-->


## Architecture vs Micro-architecture <!--fc-->
The architecture consists of everything that is visible to software such as instructions and registers.
The micro-architecture comprises the implementation of the architecture (instruction caches, translation lookaside buffers, branch predictors, pipelined datapath).
<!--ID: 1722043380772-->


### Pipeline <!--fc-->
CPUs have facilities for executing more than one instruction at the same time.
It might have separate fetch, decode, and execute units so that while it is executing instruction $n$, it can be decoding instruction $n+1$ and fetching instruction $n+2$.

<!--ID: 1722043380782-->


### Superscalar <!--fc-->
More advanced than a pipeline, a *superscalar CPU* has multiple execution units (e.g.: one for int arithmetic, one for floats, one for boolean operations)
Two ore more instructions are fetched at once, decoded, and dumped into a holding buffer until they can be executed.
As soon as an execution unit becomes available, it looks in the holding buffer to see if there is an instruction it can handle.

<!--ID: 1722043380792-->



### System Call <!--fc-->
For processes in user mode to obtains services from the OS, they must make a system call, which taps into the kernel and invokes the OS.
<!--ID: 1722043380800-->


### Multithreading/Hyperthreading <!--fc-->
Allows the CPU to hold the state of two different threads and switch back and forth on a nanosecond timescale, i.e.: not true parallelism.
<!--ID: 1722043380806-->


### Cores <!--fc-->
CPUs now have multiple more complete processors or *cores* on them. These effectively charry multiple minichips on them, each with its own independent CPU
![[Pasted image 20240726172140.png]]
<!--ID: 1722043380810-->


### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) <!--fc-->
A processor with thousands of tiny cores. They are good for small computations done in parallel, like rendering polygons in graphics applications.
<!--ID: 1722043380814-->


## Memory

### Memory Hierarchy <!--fc-->
Since memory cannot be large, fast, and cheap all at the same time, it is constructed as a hierarchy of layers.
Top layers have higher speed, lower capacity
Bottom layers have lower speed, higher capacity
![[Pasted image 20240726172446.png]]
<!--ID: 1722043380819-->


### Cache <!--fc-->
Controlled by the hardware, slightly slower than registers
Divided into cache lines, typically 64 bytes
$$
0 -63| 64-127| etc
$$
When a program needs a memory word, it will check to see if it is in the cache. If it is, that is known as a *cache hit.*
<!--ID: 1722043380823-->


### Main Memory <!--fc-->
Slower than caches, usually called RAM. All CPU requests that cannot by satisfied out of the cache go to main memory.
<!--ID: 1722043380827-->


### MMU (Memory Management Unit) <!--fc-->
Part of the CPU that maps virtual memory addresses from processes to physical memory addresses in ram.
<!--ID: 1722043380831-->


## I/O Devices

### I/O Controller <!--fc-->
I/O devices generally consist of two parts; a controller and the device itself. 
The controller is a set of chips that physically controls the device. It accepts commands from the OS
<!--ID: 1722043380835-->


### Device Driver <!--fc-->
Since each type of controller is different, different software is needed to control each one. The software that talks to a controller, giving it commands and accepting responses, is called a *device driver.*
To be used, the driver has to be put into the OS so it can run in kernel mode.
<!--ID: 1722054029346-->


### I/O port space <!--fc-->
Every controller has a small number of registers that are used to communicate with it
*e.g.: a minimal disk controller might have registers for specifying disc address, memory address, sector count and direction (read/write)*
The collection of of all device registers forms the *I/O port space*
<!--ID: 1722054029367-->


### Methods of I/O

#### Busy Waiting <!--fc-->
The simplest method of I/O
A user program issues a system call, which the kernel then translates into a procedure call to the appropriate driver. The driver then starts the I/O an sits in a loop continuously polling the device to see if it is done.
When done, the driver puts the data where needed and returns.
<!--ID: 1722054029372-->


#### Interrupt <!--fc-->
Method of I/O
The driver starts the device and asks it to give an interrupt when finished. At that point, the driver returns.
The OS then blocks the caller if need be and looks for other work to do.
When the controller detects the end of the transfer, it generates an *interrupt* to signal completion.
![[Pasted image 20240726214717.png]]
1. Driver tells controller what to do by writing to device regs. The controller then starts the device.
2. When the controller finished reading/writing the bytes it has been instructed to transfer, it signals the interrupt.
3. If the interrupt controller is ready to accept the interrupt (may be handling higher priority interrupt), it asserts a pin on the CPU chip telling it
4. The interrupt controller puts the number of the device on the bus so the CPU can read it and know what device as just finished.
<!--ID: 1722054029378-->



##### Interrupt Vector Table <!--fc-->
Once the CPU has decided to take an interrupt, the program counter and PSW are pushed onto the current stack and the CPU switches to kernel mode. The device number may be used as an index to find the address of the interrupt handler for the device. 
The part of memory is called the *interrupt vector table*.
<!--ID: 1722054029387-->


#### DMA <!--fc-->
**Direct Memory Access**, special hardware used for a method of I/O.
It's a chip that can control the flow of bits between memory and some controller without constant CPU intervention.
<!--ID: 1722054029394-->


## Buses

### Shared bus architecture <!--fc-->
Means that multiple devices use the same wires to transfer data. Thus, when multiple devices have data to send. you need an arbiter to determine who can use the bus
<!--ID: 1722054029400-->


### Parallel bus architecture <!--fc-->
Means that you send each word of data over multiple wires
*e.g.: a 32-bit number is sent over 32 parallel wires.*
<!--ID: 1722054029406-->


### PCIe <!--fc-->
**Peripheral Component Interconnect Express**
A data bus capable of transferring tens of gigabits per second. The main bus on most PCs.
<!--ID: 1722054029410-->


### Serial bus architecture <!--fc-->
Used by PCIe,
sends all bits in a message through a single connection (*lane*), much like a network packet.
Parallelism is still used, because you can have multiple lanes.
<!--ID: 1722054029415-->


### USB <!--fc-->
**Universal Serial Bus**
Attaches slow I/O devices to the computer. Any USB device can be connected to a computer and function immediately without the need for rebooting
<!--ID: 1722054029419-->


## Booting The Computer

### BIOS <!--fc-->
**Basic Input Output System**
On the motherboard a small amount of flash memory holds a program called the system firmware, which we commonly still refer to as the BIOS.
BIOS was used on old IBM PCs and was very slow and architecture dependent and only allowed storage up to 2 TB
<!--ID: 1722054029428-->


#### MBR <!--fc-->
**Master Boot Record**, Used in BIOS firmware.
The first sector from the boot device that is read into memory and executed
Contains a program that exams the partition table at the end of the boot sector to determine which partition is active. The secondary boot leader will then be read from that partition. This starts the OS.
<!--ID: 1722054029437-->



### UEFI <!--fc-->
**Unified Extensible Firmware Interface**
A replacement for BIOS, remedies its issues.
Allows for fast booting, different architectures, and storage sizes up to 8 ZiB.
<!--ID: 1722054029447-->


#### GPT <!--fc-->
**GUID Partition Table**, used in UEFI firmware.
The partition table in the second sector of the device (MBR is in first),
contains info about the location of various partitions on the SSD or disc. Rather than a single boot sector, the boot process can rely on a proper file system containing programs, config files, or anything else that would be useful during boot.
