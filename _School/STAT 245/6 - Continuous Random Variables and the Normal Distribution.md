# The Normal Probability Distribution

## Probability density function of normal distribution <!--fc-->
The probability density of the normal distribution is

where
$$
\begin{gather}
\text{mean = expected value of x = }E(x) = \mu \\
\text{standard deviation = }\sigma = \sqrt{ \sigma^2 }

\end{gather}
$$

## Normal probability distribution curve properties <!--fc-->
A normal probability distribution, when plotted, gives a bell-shaped curve such that
1. The total area under the curve is 1.0
2. The curve is symmetric about the mean
3. The two tails of the curve extend indefinitely

## Standard normal distribution <!--fc-->
A normal distribution with $\mu =0$ and $\sigma =1$

## What determines the shape of the normal distribution? <!--fc-->
The shape of the distribution is determined by $\sigma$, the population standard deviation.
- Large values of $\sigma$ reduce the height of the curve and increase the spread
- Small values of $\sigma$ increase the height of the curve and reduce the spread

## Finding probability of variable lying within interval of normal curve
To find the probability that a normal random variable $x$ lies in the interval $a$ to $b$, we need to find the area under the normal curve between the points $a$ and $b$.
