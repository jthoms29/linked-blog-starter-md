# Sampling Distribution

## Sampling Distribution of $\bar{x}$
The probability distribution of $\bar{x}$ is called its sampling distribution. It lists the various values that $\bar{x}$ can assume and the probability of each value of $\bar{x}$

## Sampling error
The *sampling error* is the difference between the value of a sample statistic and the value of the corresponding population parameter. In the case of the mean:
$$
\text{Sampling error = }\bar{x}-\mu
$$


## Non-sampling error
The errors that occur in the collection, recording, and tabulation of data

# Applications of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$

## ==Normalized sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$== <!--fc-->
For $\bar{x}$ distribution, the standard normalized $z$ is defined as
$$
z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}
$$
This is similar to the formula for standardizing a normal distribution for a single value, the only difference being the $\sqrt{ n }$. The last formula was for a single $x$, this is for the average.

# Population and Sample Proportion

## Mean of sampling Distribution $\hat{p}$ <!--fc-->
The mean of a sampling distribution of $\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n}$ (proportion) is:
$$
\mu_{\hat{p}}=p
$$

## Standard deviation of sampling distribution $\hat{p}$ <!--fc-->
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\hat{p} = \frac{x}{n}$ is
$$
\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{ \left( \frac{p(1-p)}{n} \right) }
$$

## ==Normalizing a sample proportion ($z$ value)== <!--fc-->
$$
z = \frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{ \frac{p(1-p)}{n} }}
$$
$\hat{p}$ is the value being plugged in
