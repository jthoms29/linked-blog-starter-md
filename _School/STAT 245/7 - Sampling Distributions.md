# Sampling Distribution

## Sampling Distribution of $\bar{x}$
The probability distribution of $\bar{x}$ is called its sampling distribution. It lists the various values that $\bar{x}$ can assume and the probability of each value of $\bar{x}$

## Sampling error
The *sampling error* is the difference between the value of a sample statistic and the value of the corresponding population parameter. In the case of the mean:
$$
\text{Sampling error = }\bar{x}-\mu
$$


## Non-sampling error
The errors that occur in the collection, recording, and tabulation of data

# Applications of the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$

## Sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$
For $\bar{x}$ distribution, $z$ is defined as
$$
z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{ n }}}
$$
