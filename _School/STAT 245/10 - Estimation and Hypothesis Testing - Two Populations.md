## Confidence interval between two large populations
If sample size $n_{1} > 30$ and $n_{2}>30$, then:

### General equation for confidence interval between two large populations <!--fc-->
$$
(\bar{x_{1}}-\bar{x_{2}}) \pm z\sqrt{ \left( \frac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} \right)+\left( \frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}} \right) }
$$
In which $z$ is the $z$ value of the desired confidence percentage.
**If 0 is in the confidence interval, they are similar. If not, they are different.**
