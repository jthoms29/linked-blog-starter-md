# Intro to Univariate Statistics
We may identify two 'kinds' of statistics

## Descriptive Statistics <!--fc-->
The presentation, organization, and description of data (graphs, means, standard deviations, etc.)
Descriptive statistics leads to ideas about *probability*
<!--ID: 1718921659214-->

## Inferential Statistics <!--fc-->
The use of probability to infer things about a population from a sample through use of hypothesis testing.
<!--ID: 1718944559939-->

# Basic Definitions

## Data <!--fc-->
The numbers we collect (plural, datum is singular)
<!--ID: 1718996683146-->

## Sample <!--fc-->
A portion of the population selected for a sample
<!--ID: 1719941322441-->


### Random Sample <!--fc-->
A sample drawn is such a way that each element of the population has a chance of being selected
<!--ID: 1719941322463-->


### Simple random sampling <!--fc-->
Occurs when all samples of the same size are selected from a population with the same chance of being selected
<!--ID: 1719941322471-->



## Variable <!--fc-->
A mathematical term used to denote something that can take on a range of variables
<!--ID: 1718996683152-->


### Independent Variable <!--fc-->
You set the value, a.k.a. *explanatory variable*
<!--ID: 1718996683156-->


### Dependent Variable <!--fc-->
Value set (generally caused) by the independent variable, a.k.a. *outcome variable*
<!--ID: 1718996683161-->

### Random Variable <!--fc-->
A dependent variable with random noise added. Denoted by a capital letter like *X*, defined by their probability distribution
<!--ID: 1718996683165-->


# Types of Data

## Qualitative Variable <!--fc-->
Described by a word, e.g. gender with 'values' male or female. Converted to *discrete quantitative variables* before analysis (e.g. male = 1, female = 2)
<!--ID: 1718996683170-->

## Quantitative Variables

### Discrete Variable <!--fc-->
Integer valued. In mathematical symbols $x \in \mathbb{Z}$. e.g. -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...etc
<!--ID: 1718996683177-->

### Continuous Variable <!--fc-->
Real values, essentially any number. $x \in \mathbb{R}$. 
<!--ID: 1718996683183-->

## Dataset <!--fc-->
A collection of observations on one or more variables
<!--ID: 1719942261292-->


## Grouping <!--fc-->
Continuous variables can be converted to discrete variables by *grouping*:
		heights $\leq$ 5 ft = 'short' (group value = 1)
		heights $\gt$ 5 ft = 'tall' (group value = 2)
*Groups* are also known as *classes*.

# Measurement Scales (avoid this)
The SPSS helper program may attempt to classify data into "scales" that try to go somewhat beyond the integers and real numbers. You won't be using these
![[Pasted image 20240621155240.png]]
SPSS lets you specify a measurement scale under *Measure* in *Variable View*. Set this to *Unknown* or *Scale*

# Kinds of Sampling and Studies
All mathematical statistical tests assume *random sampling*. The probability distributions that are used are *defined* by random sampling. 
There are different kinds of sampling, even though we won't go into all
