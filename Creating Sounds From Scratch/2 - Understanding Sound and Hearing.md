# Timbre - Harmonic Structure <!--fc-->
Timbre is the distinct character or quality of a sounds, independent of its pitch and intensity
*i.e.; a clarinet and trumpet both playing an A-440 pitch. The pitch is the same but the sounds are distinct*
Differences in timbre are caused by the presence of waves other than the 440 Hz fundamental frequency

# Harmonics, Partials, and Overtones

## Harmonics <!--fc-->
Sine waves at frequencies that make up the harmonic series and begin with the fundamental as #1 and continue with its integer multiples. All frequencies above the fundamental are considered overtones, but only integer multiples are harmonics
<!--ID: 1717789107600-->


## Partials <!--fc-->
Any frequency within a complex sound
<!--ID: 1717789107608-->


## Subharmonics <!--fc-->
Frequencies produces below the fundamental

## Phase <!--fc-->
Describes the combination of two identical (or very similar) sounds separated by a time interval. This is measured in degrees.

## Pitch <!--fc-->
A function of the frequency of a tone that is perceived when a sound is at least 2 ms in duration
<!--ID: 1717789107623-->


# Amplitude <!--fc-->
Zooming away from the amplitude over time plots so that individual wave cycles are no longer visible reveals the longer-term trend of a sound
<!--ID: 1717789107628-->


# Stages of a Sound <!--fc-->
Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release
